/** The virtual interface between a path follower / plan executor and a real
 * mobile platform (vehicle, robot), regarding controlling its motion.
 *
 * To enable the use of this library with a new robot, the user must define
 * a new class derived from this virtual class and implement all pure virtual
 * and the desired virtual methods according to the docs below.
 *
 * This class does not make assumptions about the kinematic model of the robot,
 * so it can work with either Ackermann, differential-driven or
 * holonomic robots. It will depend on the used PTGs, so checkout each PTG
 * documentation for the lenght and meaning of velocity commands.
 *
 * Assumptions: The platform...
 * - has a global localization system (e.g. particle filter) with
 *   respect to some fixed global frame of reference `map`, see
 *   get_localization().
 * - has odometry with a fixed global frame of reference `odom`, see
 *   get_odometry().
 * - is able to execute motion primitives according to one or more PTGs,
 * - is able to keep one immediately-running motion primitive and optionally
 *   another one in a queue, which will be executed when a given condition
 *   holds; see motion_execute(). This mechanism ensures accurately path
 *   following without computer-robot communication delays affecting the plan.

     * doing and executes the given immediate command, dropping possible former
     * immediate and next commands.

     *  2) `immediate` set, `next` set: replaces both vehicle execution "slots"

     *  3) `immediate` not set, `next` set: should be received by a vehicle only
     * while there is an "immediate" motion command under execution, and the
     * "next" slot is free. This stores a new "next" motion command, leaving the
     * currently-executing one untouched. When the "next condition" holds true,
     * the "next" slot will replace the "immediate" slot and "next" will be free
     * again.
